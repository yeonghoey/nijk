# Collections
A collection is compiled by [../scripts/compile_collection.py](../scripts/compile_collection.py).
Since collection can be generated from [../presets](../presets) and the size of a collection is quite large,
they are not committed intentionally.

Each line of a collections is a context, comprises space-separated terms.
